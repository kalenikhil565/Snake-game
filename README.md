 Snake Game in C++
Overview
This is a simple console-based Snake Game implemented in C++ using basic programming concepts. The game involves navigating a snake on a 20x20 grid to collect food while avoiding collisions with walls or the snake's own body.

How to Run
Prerequisites:

A C++ compiler such as g++.
A console or terminal environment (Windows, Linux, or Mac).
Steps to Compile and Run:

Save the game code in a file named snake_game.cpp.
Open a terminal or command prompt in the file's directory.
Compile the code using the command:
bash
Copy code
g++ snake_game.cpp -o snake_game
Run the game with:
bash
Copy code
./snake_game   # For Linux/Mac
snake_game.exe # For Windows
How to Play
Objective: Guide the snake to collect food (O) and grow as long as possible.
Controls:
Use W to move UP.
Use A to move LEFT.
Use S to move DOWN.
Use D to move RIGHT.
The snake starts in the middle of the grid and grows longer each time it eats food.
Avoid hitting the walls (#) or the snake's own body (o).
The game ends if a collision occurs.
Game Mechanics
Snake Movement:

The snake moves continuously in the current direction.
Use the controls to change its direction.
Food Generation:

Food appears randomly within the grid.
The snake grows longer when it eats food.
Collision Detection:

The game checks for collisions with:
Walls: Snake hits the boundary of the grid.
Self: Snake runs into its own body.
Scoring:

The score is the length of the snake minus one (the starting length).
