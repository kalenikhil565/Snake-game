# Snake Game in C++

This is a simple console-based **Snake Game** implemented in C++ using basic programming concepts. The game involves navigating a snake on a 20x20 grid to collect food while avoiding collisions with walls or the snake's own body.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler such as `g++`.
- A console or terminal environment (Windows, Linux, or Mac).

### Steps to Compile and Run
1. Save the game code in a file named `snake_game.cpp`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the file's directory.
3. Compile the code using the command:
   ```bash
   g++ snake_game.cpp -o snake_game


### How to Add Images
To add images in your `README.md`:

1. **Save Images**: Save the images you want to display (such as `game_start.png`, `snake_growing.png`, and `game_over.png`).
2. **Upload Images to GitHub**:
   - Place the images in a folder in your GitHub repository (e.g., `/images/`).
   - Use the relative path to the images in your markdown file.

For example, if your images are stored in the `images/` folder of your project, your markdown links would look like:

```markdown
![Game Start](images/game_start.png)
![Snake Growing](images/snake_growing.png)
![Game Over](images/game_over.png)
